<h3 align="left">This project was built using React.js and Neon's PGSQL Database.</h3>

###

<p align="left">Because React.js primarily focuses on client-side rendering, I determined it was the best approach to eliminate the use of express and other packages to focus primarily on the client side. The following API's were used in place:</p>

###

<h2 align="left">React-Router || Express</h2>

###

<p align="left">https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing<br>React-Router was used in place of Express's Views Engine to use client-side routing instead of server side routing. The use-case is extremely similar to Express as it involves initializing your your specified routes to different pages on the main script file.</p>

###

<p align="left">https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver<br>The Neon serverless driver is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over HTTP or WebSockets in place of TCP.</p>

<p align="left">https://react-hook-form.com/<br>React-Hook-Form was used to extract data from inputted form fields into key-value pairs to be used in SQL queries.</p>
